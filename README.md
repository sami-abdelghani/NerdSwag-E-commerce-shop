# NerdSwag E-commerce-shop
This is a repository for the Front-End of my NerdSwag E-commerce shop project. I made a project to simulate e-commerce shop themed around selling products from my favorite games and shows as if the products were real. I made this project to learn and gain more experience in fullstack web development. This repository is for the front-end portion of my project and you should check out my back-end portion of the project by going to the NerdSwag-API repository.
